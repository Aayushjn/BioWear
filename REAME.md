# BioWear

BioWear is an IoT based remote health monitoring system which has sensors embedded within a jacket.
The sensors read data from LM-35 temperature sensor, pulse rate sensor and an ADXL345 accelerometer. This data is uploaded to Firebase cloud via a ESP8266 module interfaced with an Arduino Lilypad.
